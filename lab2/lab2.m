%% Q1 - Different Kernels
% We will apply three different kernels in the spatial domain with one
% sharpening, one smoothing and apply them in different sizes.
% 
% Firstly we begin with showing the original image that we will use.
figure;
imshow(camera);

%%
% Now, let's introduce a mean filter of size $3 \times 3$ and apply the
% convolution using *imfilter*. The mean filtered image is shown below.

h1 = fspecial('average', 3);
meancamera3 = imfilter(camera, h1);

figure;
imshow(meancamera3);

%%
% And using mean filter of sie $7 \times 7$ we get
h2 = fspecial('average', 7);
meancamera7 = imfilter(camera, h2);

figure;
imshow(meancamera7);

%%
% And lastly, a $31 \times 31$ mean filter.
%
h3 = fspecial('average', 31);
meancamera31 = imfilter(camera, h3);

figure;
imshow(meancamera31);

%%
% Lets introduce gaussian filters and perform the same calculations as
% above. Since the gaussian filter is based on the gaussian distribution
% We also have an additional parameter in addition to the
% size of the kernel, namely $\sigma$. We have assumed this to be $\sigma =
% 3$ for this exercise. We use the function imgaussfilt due to the
% documentation recommending to use that one instead of imfilter.
gausscamera3 = imgaussfilt(camera, 3, FilterSize=3);

figure;
imshow(gausscamera3);

%%
% And using a gaussian filter size of $7 \times 7$ we get
gausscamera7 = imgaussfilt(camera, 3, FilterSize=7);

figure;
imshow(gausscamera7);

%%
% And lastly using a gaussian filter size of $31 \times 31$ we get
gausscamera31 = imgaussfilt(camera, 3, FilterSize=31);

figure;
imshow(gausscamera31);

%% 
% For a sharpening (high pass) filter, we will use a unsharp masking of 
% the mean filter for different sizes. Below we do this for a $3 \times 3$
% unsharping mean filter.
size = 3;
h4 = fspecial('average', size);
h4 = h4 * -1;
h4(size - floor(size/2), size - floor(size/2)) = h4(size - floor(size/2), size - floor(size/2)) + 1;

msharpcamera3 = imfilter(camera, h4);

figure;
imshow(msharpcamera3);

%%
% And once again for the mask of size $7 \times 7$
size = 7;
h5 = fspecial('average', size);
h5 = h5 * -1;
h5(size - floor(size/2), size - floor(size/2)) = h5(size - floor(size/2), size - floor(size/2)) + 1;

msharpcamera7 = imfilter(camera, h5);

figure;
imshow(msharpcamera7);

%%
% And lastly, one last time for the mask of size $31 \times 31Â£
size = 31;
h6 = fspecial('average', size);
h6 = h6 * -1;
h6(size - floor(size/2), size - floor(size/2)) = h6(size - floor(size/2), size - floor(size/2)) + 1;

msharpcamera31 = imfilter(camera, h6);

figure;
imshow(msharpcamera31);

%% Q2 -  Low Pass Filters
% In fspecial we have the filters *average*, *disk* and *gaussian*. All of
% which are instances of low-pass filters. They calculate new pixel values
% by incorporating neighbouring pixel values and "average" the rapid
% changes. The *average* filter does this by calculating the sample mean of
% the defined neighbourhood, disk uses thhe same notion but uses a circular
% notion of distance from the center and the gaussian uses a gaussian
% distribution where pixels far away affect the new pixel value less.

%% Q3 - Construct new filters from simple arithmetic.
% A low pass filter can be denoted $lp(x, y)$. We know from the textbook
% that a high-pass image $hp(x,y) = \delta(x, y) - lp(x, y)$ i.e
% subtracting a low pass from the original image. 
imshow(camera - gausscamera31);

%%
% A bandreject filter is a
% original image minus a low pass and a high pass filter. But since we have
% defined the highpass filter in terms of a low pass, we can also define
% bandreject from only low pass filters.

imshow(camera - (gausscamera31 + (camera - meancamera31)));

%% Q4 - The Sobel Filter
% Lets apply the filter on the cameraman image. Since this is a directional
% kernel, some arithmetic must be done on the two images.
h7 = fspecial('sobel');
camerasobelx = imfilter(double(camera), h7);
camerasobely = imfilter(double(camera), h7');

figure;
imshow(uint8(sqrt(camerasobelx.^2 + camerasobely.^2)));

%%
% We also do the same of the wagon image

wagonsobelx = imfilter(double(wagon), h7);
wagonsobely = imfilter(double(wagon), h7');

figure;
imshow(uint8(sqrt(wagonsobelx.^2 + wagonsobely.^2)));
